The Bookscape project aims to create an intuitive and functional platform for managing and purchasing books online.
This site was specifically designed for book enthusiasts, particularly fans of novels, romantic comedies, and other popular genres.
Bookscape seeks to offer a unique experience that allows users to easily explore and purchase their favorite books remotely. This initiative addresses the growing need for access to an online library where readers can discover new titles while simplifying the purchasing process without the need to travel.
The primary goal was to develop a solution that meets users’ needs while providing efficient product management tools for administrators.

1. Technologies Used
•Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to design a clear and responsive user interface.
•Backend: PHP was chosen to handle server-side operations, such as managing users, orders, and products.
•Database: MySQL was used to store information about books, users, orders, and reviews.

3. Architecture
•Simplified MVC Model: A separation between frontend pages and backend operations was implemented for better organization.

4. Complementary Tools
•Visual Studio Code: The main development environment.
•PhpMyAdmin: An interface for managing the MySQL database.
